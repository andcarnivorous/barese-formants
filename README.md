# Formant values for Barese variety


This repo stores non-normalized formant values for some speakers of the Barese variety and some plots ready to use made with matplotlib. The formants were collected from data obtained through word-list readings.

**More data will be added in the next months**

### Dir Structure

The wordlist is stored in the Formants directory. The directories ending with _A store formants collected from adults while the others store formants collected from high school students and young adults.

### Plots

The allinfphon.png shows all the informants' formants plotted in R with vowels in the legend sorted by their stress and phonologic transcription.

The plots made with matplotlib are purely demonstrative, if anyone know of any python package that allows for a simpler way to plot formants please let me know.
